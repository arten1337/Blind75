â€‹Approach 1: Brute Force
=============
The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to target - x.

### Time Complexity - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
### Space Complexity - O(1)

Approach 2: Sort and Two Pointer
=============
Sort the array in non decreasing order. Pointer low = first index of array, high = last index of array. Take sum of values on low and high. 
If sum is less than target, increment low, if sum is more than target, decrement high.

Approach 3: Hash Table
=============
